The Seven Deadly sins consist of cards that are always peril and hidden away from everyone but the investigators who draw them. They are meant to cause tension as they take up a space in the investigator's hand, and they inhibit the investigator from doing certain things. Featuring the new ***Sin*** keyword, they prevent players from discussing the cards with one another.

Most of the cards are hidden away or promote Surge. Max limit two ***Sin*** cards per hand. This is to prevent a player from being the sacrifice and hoarding all the ***Sin*** cards while everyone else can cover the rest. It's also meant to not overwhelm the players in lower player counts or solo scenarios.
